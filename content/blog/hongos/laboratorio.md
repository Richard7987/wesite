To have a small mushroom cultivation laboratory at home and ensure that the products are safe for consumption, I recommend the following:

## 1. **Adequate space:**
- A clean and well-ventilated area, free of contaminants.
- It can be a room or a dedicated space within your modular greenhouse.


## 2. **Basic equipment:**
- Modular shelving (like the ones you mentioned in your project) to accommodate the cubes.
- Thermometers and hygrometers to monitor temperature and humidity.
- LED grow lights that emit light of adequate spectrum for mushroom growth.
- HEPA filters to keep the air clean and free of contaminants.
- Microwave or sterilizer to sterilize substrates before inoculating them.


## 3. **Substrates and cultivation tools:**
- Specific substrates such as straw, sawdust, or grains, suitable for each type of mushroom.
- Spores or mycelium of the mushrooms you wish to cultivate.
- Sterile syringes to inoculate the spores into the substrate.


## 4. **Cultivation conditions:**
- Temperature and humidity control adequate for the type of mushroom.
- Aeration control to prevent the growth of mold or bacteria.


## 5. **Equipment for pill production:**
- Pressing machine to compact the dried mushroom into pill form.
- Dehydrator to dry the mushrooms before processing them.
- Mortar and pestle or grinder to pulverize the dried mushrooms.
- Tinctures or extracts (if you decide to create concentrated extracts) with safe solvents like alcohol.


## 6. **Safety precautions:**
- Clear labeling of each cultivation batch and pill produced.
- Quality control: It is important to verify that the mushrooms are edible and free of contaminants such as molds or bacteria.
- Research edible species: Make sure the mushrooms you cultivate are safe and edible, such as button mushrooms (*Agaricus bisporus*) or shiitake (*Lentinula edodes*).


## 7. **Documentation and study:**
- Keep a detailed record of each cultivation to study the process and optimize production.
