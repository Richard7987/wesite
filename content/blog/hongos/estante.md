The vertical shelf is the structural and intelligent support of the cultivation system. It acts as the physical and digital axis for the connection of the modular cubes.


## 1. 📏 Vertical Rails

- **📦 Modular design:**
  - The shelf will have **vertical rails** that allow cubes to be easily inserted or removed.
  - Each rail is designed to support multiple cubes without compromising stability or accessibility.

- **🔁 Individual configuration per cube:**
  - Through the app, each cube can be **configured independently** according to the mushroom species being cultivated.
  - This allows for maintaining different microclimates on the same shelf.


## 2. 🧠 Central Processing Platform

- **🧩 Main system control:**
  - Receives and processes data on temperature, humidity, CO₂, crop status, etc., from all connected cubes.
  - Executes the AI logic that automatically adjusts the internal conditions of each module.

- **⚡ Power distribution:**
  - Manages the **electrical power** of all cubes through connections integrated into the rails.
  - Includes a **backup system (UPS)** to maintain operation during power outages.

- **📡 Communication with the local network/internet:**
  - Connects to the network to allow remote monitoring, notifications, and system updates.


> 🧬 The shelf not only physically organizes the cubes, but also functions as the brain and backbone of the cultivation laboratory.
