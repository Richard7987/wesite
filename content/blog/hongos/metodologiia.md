A step-by-step plan to design, build, and implement a modular and intelligent system for automated mushroom cultivation.


## 🔍 [1. Research and Planning](@/blog/hongos/investigacioon.md)

Before building, it is vital to research and plan:

- **Species to cultivate:** Sinocubila, Codycrps, Lion's Mane, etc.
- **Ideal parameters:** Temperature, humidity, CO₂ for each mushroom.
- **Materials and components:** Research options for cubes, sensors, heating, ventilation, and humidification.


## 🧱 2. Modular Cube Prototype Design

Once the requirements are defined, start with the initial design:

- **Structural sketch:** Define the external and internal structure.
- **Recommended materials:** Acrylic, resistant plastic, etc.
- **Component location:** Distribution of sensors, actuators, and space for the mushroom.


## 🔌 3. Electronic Components Prototype

Before assembling the cube, test each component separately:

- **Ventilation and heating:** Ensure a stable environment without overheating.
- **Sensors:**
  - Temperature and humidity in a controlled space.
  - CO₂, validating its accuracy.
- **Ultrasonic humidifier:** That it works without affecting other components.
- **Camera:** Verify that it captures well in low light.


## 🧰 4. First Modular Cube Construction

With the materials and tests ready, assemble the first cube:

- **Physical assembly:** Ensure enough space for the mushroom and components.
- **Sensor/actuator installation:** In the space between the inner and outer cube.
- **Power system:** Stable source and quick connection system for the shelf.


## 🧠 5. System Programming and Integration

With the cube built, integrate the software:

- **AI for environmental control:** Training with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Control app:** Web/mobile app to enter the mushroom, view data, and receive notifications.
- **Wi-Fi (ESP32):** To connect the cube with the AI.
- **Integrated tests:** Everything connected, verifying the response to the entered mushroom.


## 🧪 6. Prototype Testing and Adjustments

Perform complete tests with the operational cube:

- **Environmental control:** Automatic adjustments from the AI.
- **Growth monitoring:** Camera and AI detecting maturity.
- **Sensor calibration:** Ensures reliable readings, adjust if necessary.


## 🗂️ 7. Vertical Shelf Fabrication and Scalability

Once the prototype is validated:

- **Shelf design with rails:** To easily insert and remove cubes.
- **Multiple cube tests:** Verify integration with the central power and processing system.


## 📊 8. Monitoring and Final Adjustments

With the complete system in operation:

- **Climate adjustment:** Verify healthy growth.
- **AI evaluation:** Ensures it manages different species in parallel well.


## 🌱 9. Project Expansion

When everything works correctly:

- **Scalability:** Reproduce more cubes for new mushrooms.
- **AI optimization:** Continuous improvement with the collected data.
