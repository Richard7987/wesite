## Project Summary

This project involves the development of a modular, intelligent, and fully automated system for cultivating edible and medicinal mushrooms. Each unit functions as an independent ecosystem, automatically monitored and adjusted by artificial intelligence, with full control from a mobile application or web dashboard.

The system is designed to optimize the growing conditions for different mushroom species, maximizing production while minimizing human intervention.

## System Components

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure and Design

- **Modular structure:** Vertical shelf with cubes of different sizes
- **[Cubes](@/blog/hongos/cubos.md):** Each cube has its own environmental control system
- **Substrate material:** Varies by species (straw, sawdust, coffee, etc.)
- **Thermal insulation:** To maintain stable conditions regardless of the external environment

### üå°Ô∏è Automated Environmental Control

Each cube will have sensors and actuators to maintain an autonomous microclimate, adjusted according to the type of mushroom entered via the app.

| Sensors     | Actuators                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Temperature | Humidifiers / Dehumidifiers        |
| Humidity    | Fans / Air extractors              |
| CO‚ÇÇ         | Water pumps (automated irrigation) |
| Light       | Programmable LED lighting          |

*Each cube automatically adjusts these parameters based on the selected mushroom species.*

### ü§ñ AI for Monitoring and Management

- Database with ideal parameters for each species
- Computer vision to monitor and predict harvest time
- Learning algorithms for continuous optimization

| Component        | Technology                                                        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameras          | One per cube to capture periodic images                           |
| Machine Learning | Models with **YOLOv8**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch**            |
| Analysis         | Automatic detection of growth and maturity                        |
| Adaptation       | Environmental adjustment based on visual analysis of the mushroom |

### üîÅ Automation and Communication

- Central management platform for all cubes
- Microcontrollers like **ESP32 / ESP8266** or **Raspberry Pi** in each cube
- Communication based on **MQTT + Python**
- Automation with **Node-RED** or **Home Assistant**

### üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

A web or app platform to control, visualize, and receive notifications.

| Functionalities                  | Technologies                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Mushroom type selection per cube | **Backend:** Flask, Django, or FastAPI (Python)   |
| Real-time data visualization     | **Frontend:** Grafana (visualization)             |
| Harvest notifications            | **Interface:** Home Assistant (intuitive control) |
| Manual parameter control         | **Mobile:** PWA or native app                     |
