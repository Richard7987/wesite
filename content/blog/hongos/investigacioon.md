Before starting with the design and construction of the cultivation system, it is essential to carry out detailed research that allows you to understand the environment and the specific needs of each mushroom species. Here are the key steps you should cover:

## 1. 🧬 Research of mushroom species
- 📚 **Target species**: Sinocubila, Codycrps, Lion's Mane, among others.
- 🌡️ **Key parameters**: Research ideal temperature, humidity levels, CO₂ needs, photoperiod (if applicable), and growth cycles.
- 🧠 **Recommendation**: Make a technical sheet for each mushroom with its requirements to facilitate automation.


## 2. ⚙️ Study of environmental control systems
- 🌡️ **Control systems**: Learn how to control temperature, humidity, and CO₂ in closed or indoor crops.
- 📦 **Suitable materials**: Evaluate options such as resistant plastic, acrylic, polycarbonate, or bioplastics.
- 📡 **Sensors and modules**: Research which sensors are more accurate and compatible with microcontrollers such as ESP32 or Raspberry Pi (e.g., DHT22, MH-Z19, etc.).
- 🧪 **Heating and humidification**: Explore methods such as PTC resistors, ultrasonic humidifiers, and silent fans.


## 3. 📐 Definition of project parameters
- 📏 **Modular design**: Establish a standard size and shape for the cube (e.g., 20x20x20 cm) to facilitate scalability.
- 🔩 **Key components**: Define the list of sensors, actuators, and modules (ventilation, heating, humidification, lighting, camera, etc.).
- 🧠 **Control AI**: Specify which parameters the AI will control, whether supervised learning will be used, and how it will be integrated with the monitoring app.
- 💡 **Energy efficiency**: Consider which energy sources you will use (USB-C, batteries, solar panels, etc.).


> 🧭 Good research now will save costly mistakes and unnecessary redesigns later. Use this stage to lay the solid foundations of your automated ecosystem.
