## 🎭 Concept

This version **removes the illusion of control**. The protagonist no longer has the active role of wanting to create a short film. Here, **curiosity becomes a crack through which something incomprehensible seeps in**. This branch plays with the idea that some truths cannot be seen without consequences, and that obsession with the divine can turn into a form of madness.

## 🧩 Narrative Structure

### Scene 1: Introduction

- The protagonist is alone in his room, watching the same YouTube video about biblical inconsistencies
- The environment shows **slight visual and sound glitches**: the video pauses for just milliseconds, imperceptible distortions appear
- The protagonist doesn’t notice them, but the audience does, creating a sense of unease from the very beginning

### Scene 2: Inner Thoughts

- The camera slowly zooms in. Voice-over of the protagonist, but there’s **something strange**: sometimes there are **interferences**, fragments of a second voice that **imitates his but isn’t the same**
- He reflects on what he just heard... but the voice contradicts itself, or repeats with slight variations  
  Example:

  > "What if all this was written by humans? But why does it repeat? What if it wasn’t for us?... for us?"

### Scene 3: The Splitting

- The screen flickers. The protagonist **sees himself**, from a camera that shouldn’t exist
- He approaches the monitor, presses pause. The image freezes on his face, but **the reflection keeps moving**
- The protagonist begins to murmur, his breath short and uneven. The reflection smiles before he does
- Reality begins to fragment subtly around him

### Scene 4: The Invisible Angel

- Dim lighting. Everything looks normal, but there’s a **distant sound**, constant, like a distorted choir that **never disappears**, only growing stronger in silence
- He says:

  > "There’s something in the room, but I can’t look at it."

- The shadows on the wall **move on their own**, forming patterns that suggest something beyond human comprehension
- He tries to leave, but every time he opens the door, **he enters the same room again**. More disordered. Darker. Hotter

### Scene 5: The Entity

- At one point, **the angel partially appears**, but **we never see it completely**
- It is revealed in reflections, in flashes, in fragments: an eye among books, wings made of bones spinning in the lamp, the sound of wheels on the ceiling
- **It is never fully seen. Never in focus.** But the protagonist does see it, and **it is tearing him apart mentally**
- The physical reality of the room begins to distort in response to the angelic presence

### Scene 6: The Reverse of the Protagonist

- He sits down, exhausted. The camera slowly circles around… and we see him from behind
- There is **a figure behind him, imitating his posture**, but reversed: its eyes are where the shoulder blades should be. Its face is hidden
- The voice-over says:

  > "It’s not me. It was never me."

- The protagonist turns around… and the screen **shuts off completely**, leaving the audience with uncertainty about what they’ve witnessed

## 🎨 Visual and Psychological Resources

- **Dissonant sound design**: buzzing, distorted celestial choirs, whispers in separated channels (inverted ASMR)
- **Natural visual glitches**: as if the camera couldn’t properly capture what’s happening  
  (Inspiration: _Annihilation_, _Skinamarink_, _The Mandela Catalogue_)
- **Anomalous lighting**: impossible shadows, objects without visible light sources, unjustified flashes
- **Space-time distortion**: scene loops, doors that lead nowhere, clocks running backward

## 🔐 Hidden Message

This branch suggests that **divine knowledge is not meant for humans**. That **some concepts are so vast they shatter the mind** if one attempts to understand them.

> "The fear of God is not reverence… it is the terror of being seen, understood, and finding no reflection."

## Production Notes

- Use non-linear editing techniques to create the sensation of fragmented reality
- Work with a sound designer to layer dissonant audio effects
- Consider the use of projections for the moving shadow effects
- Film with wide-angle lenses to subtly distort spaces

> [!WARNING] Important Consideration  
> This narrative branch requires a more experimental and abstract approach, with emphasis on building an atmosphere of psychological horror rather than a linear storyline.
