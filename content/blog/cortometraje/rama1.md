## Original Concept

> This is the branch where the video forms a loop—where I do exactly this in the video: planning the same short film as I am making. The order would be: watch the video – pause it to analyze – share my thoughts about what I’m analyzing and how it sparks the idea to make a short film – and then I begin making it. I will pretend to show some notes (some real, some staged), literally presenting how I plan to create the short film for this branch.
>
> Then I’ll stop and say something like: *“Wait, I’ve already done this.”* At that moment, the protagonist looks directly into the camera, realizing he’s being watched—with a face of astonishment, fear, and horror. From another angle, the audience sees what I’m staring at: at first, **nothing**. Silence. Suspense. Suddenly, a biblical angel appears. The protagonist is paralyzed with fear, terrified, as the angel says: *“Do not be afraid.”* Then the entire room flattens into 2D, as if reality itself had paused or shifted, transporting me somewhere else. I haven’t yet decided how this new place will look. That’s where my idea ends for now—I don’t yet know what would come after.

## Scene Sequence

### Scene 1: Introduction
- The protagonist is watching a video about biblical inconsistencies
- The atmosphere is intimate, at night, with dim desk-lamp lighting (introspective mood)
- He pauses the video, staring intently at the screen
- The camera slowly zooms in on his face, building tension

### Scene 2: Inner Voice
- Voice-over of the protagonist reflecting on what he just heard
- His tone is logical, curious, but tinged with existential doubt
- He begins talking about an idea: making a short film based on what he just saw
- Subtle music begins to build an uneasy atmosphere

### Scene 3: Meta-reference
- The protagonist starts planning the very short film we are watching
- Notes, sketches, and ideas appear (some real, some staged)
- The video shifts into a kind of “fake behind-the-scenes,” breaking the fourth wall
- Subtle, almost imperceptible changes begin to occur in the background

### Scene 4: Reality Break
- Suddenly, the protagonist says out loud:
  > *“Wait... I’ve already done this.”*
- Silence. He realizes something.
- He slowly turns his face toward the camera, expression mixing confusion, horror, and revelation
- Cut to his point of view: at first, **nothing**. Silence. Suspense.
- Suddenly, a terrifying celestial figure appears: a **biblical angel** (ophanim or another non-humanoid being, covered in eyes, floating in the void)
- The protagonist freezes in absolute fear, unable to move or speak

### Scene 5: The Message
- The angel, without a mouth (or without moving one), speaks in a deep, reverberating voice:
  > *“Do not be afraid.”*
- Reality distorts: the environment flattens into 2D, as if time itself had stopped or another dimension had taken over
- The protagonist is transported elsewhere (still undefined)
- The scene ends in a fade to white, leaving the protagonist’s fate in suspense

## Visual & Technical Elements

- **Lighting**: Contrast between the warm, dim lighting at the beginning and the cold, supernatural glow of the angelic encounter
- **Sound**: Use of low frequencies and distorted audio to heighten unease
- **Special effects**: Gradual transition from 3D to 2D to convey reality distortion
- **Biblical angel**: 3D-modeled, concentric wheels with countless eyes, radiating an unnatural luminous aura

---

## Production Notes

- The angel scene requires detailed CGI and compositing work
- For the 2D transition, research “cell shading” and flattening techniques
- Consider filming in a room with full lighting control
- The actor must master the emotional transition from intellectual curiosity to existential terror
