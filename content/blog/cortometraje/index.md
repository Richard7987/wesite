## 📝 General Concept

**Genre:** Psychological horror with theological elements and cosmic horror

**Central theme:** This project explores the figure of **biblical angels** in their original representation according to ancient texts—especially the strangest and most terrifying ones such as the ophanim (wheels of fire covered in eyes). The short film contrasts these depictions with the contemporary popular interpretation (benevolent, peaceful beings) to create a profound visual and emotional impact on the audience.

**Estimated duration:** 12–15 minutes

**Target audience:** Fans of psychological horror, cosmic horror, and those interested in religious mythology

## 🧠 Inspiration & References

The project draws from diverse sources that combine theology and horror:

- **Biblical texts:** Descriptions of angels in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation
- **YouTube video:** [Inconsistencies in the Content of the Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5eLMNeeYwg)
- **Literature:** Cosmic horror in the style of Lovecraft, applied to biblical mythology
- **Film:** Influences from directors such as Ari Aster, David Lynch, and Panos Cosmatos
- **Philosophical concepts:** Fragmented reality, divided consciousness, and crisis of faith

## 🎥 Narrative Structure

The story unfolds through three possible narrative branches, each exploring psychological and cosmic horror as well as the unease of a fragmented reality from a unique perspective:

### 🔀 Narrative Branches

#### [Branch 1 - The Revelation](@/blog/cortometraje/rama1.md)
A narrative/metacommentary short film in which the protagonist analyzes the content of a video and, through his reflections, triggers an unsettling experience. The philosophical analysis leads him to discover something far more terrifying that seeps into his own life, culminating in a direct encounter with an angelic entity in its most primal and terrifying form.

#### [Branch 2 - That Which Watches From Within](@/blog/cortometraje/rama2.md)
This approach centers on the protagonist’s fractured consciousness, revealing that what he perceives is not merely a narrative but an internal manifestation of uncontrollable terror. Here, the boundaries between the real and the mental blur, leading him into a spiral of paranoia and existential dread, as angelic manifestations embody fragmented aspects of his own psyche.

#### [Branch 3 - The Verse](@/blog/cortometraje/rama3.md)
The protagonist receives a cryptic, unsettling message on his device: a verse or phrase seemingly taken from a religious context. This phrase triggers a chain of events with apparent cosmic origins, distorting his perception of reality. Each attempt to decipher the message brings him closer to understanding something he was never meant to grasp—like a formula that alters the very fabric of his existence.

## 💡 Technical & Visual Resources

### 3D Angel Models

To achieve striking representations of biblical angels, the project will use:

- **Types of angels to depict:**
  - Seraphim (six wings, covered in eyes)
  - Cherubim (four faces, multiple wings)
  - Ophanim (wheels within wheels, covered in eyes)

- **Resources for 3D models:**
  - Platforms: Sketchfab, CGTrader, TurboSquid
  - Conversion tools: Kaedim, Luma AI
  - Software: Blender with specific add-ons for texture import

### Special Effects (CGI)

Blender will be the main tool for:

- **Scene composition:**
  - Integrating 3D models into real environments
  - Reality distortion effects (glitches, time freezes)
  - Transitions between the real and the supernatural

- **Specific techniques:**
  - Integrating 3D models into video
  - Virtual cameras for impossible angles
  - Visual "reality pause" effects
