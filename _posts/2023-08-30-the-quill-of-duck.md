## The what?

This is a Duckquill post example, this post has nothing but a bunch of text and random formatting, acting like a demo.

## Some info for ya

Since you are here, lemme tell ya some nice tricks about creating posts

First, the naming. The URLs are very picky about them, so you shouldn't use spaces in them, and preferebly any other "special" character, if you managed to have a lot of posts with ugly names, you can use `rename.sh <DIR>` to fix the mess quickly, it works for any files really, useful for renaming assets.

The first thing in the name of post should be publicaion date, it should be in ISO 8601 format. On \*nix you can use `date -I` to quickly get one.

Now to the front matter, front matter in Jekyll is the weird thing at the top of Markdown file, that has 3 dashes at start and end. It includes needed info about your post so Jekyll can cook it properly. The important ones are `layout` that tells if the page are plain one or post, `title` with... well you get it, `tags` and `toc` that if exists or set to `true` will make Jekyll generate table of contents at top of the post.

Now to the _Stanley!_

## The Stanley!

This is the story of a man named _Stanley_.

_Stanley_ worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee `#427`.

Employee `#427`'s job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room `427` and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.

Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.

This is what Employee `#427` did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending,

_Stanley_ relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.

And _Stanley_ was happy.

And then one day, something very peculiar happened.

Something that would forever change _Stanley_;

Something he would never quite forget.

He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.

No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.

Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, _Stanley_ found himself unable to move for the longest time.

But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
