## Description

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.  The site is built using Zola, a static site generator written in Rust, and uses SCSS for styling.


## Requirements

* **Zola:** You will need to have Zola installed on your system.  Instructions for installation can be found on the official Zola website: [https://www.getzola.org/](https://www.getzola.org/).


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Richard7987/wesite.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd wesite`


## Usage

* **Build the website:** Run the command `zola build` in your terminal from the project's root directory. This will generate the static HTML files for your website in the `public` directory.
* **Serve the website locally:** Run the command `zola serve` in your terminal. This will start a local development server, allowing you to view your website in a browser.  The site will be accessible at `http://localhost:1111`.
